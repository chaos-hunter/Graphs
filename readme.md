The assignment interacts with graphs using an adjacency matrix representation stored in a text file. 
It accomplishes 4 different tasks related to graph traversal, displays the adjency list of the graph, performs Breadth-First Search and Depth-First Search, and outputs them in that order, and find the shortest path using Dijkstra's Algorithm.
